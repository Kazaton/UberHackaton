### Problem
Buses have become one of the most popular forms of transportation, but they often suffer from overcrowding, leading to inconvenience for passengers, especially those with special needs. Additionally, passengers are often unsure when their bus will arrive due to a lack of precise schedules and route-tracking apps.

### User Requirements
- **Bus Route and Map Interface**: Display a real-time map showing all active bus routes and their current locations.
- **Bus Schedule Tracking**: Monitor each bus according to its schedule and provide real-time updates for any delays or early arrivals.
- **Occupancy Monitoring**: Show the number of passengers on each bus, updated through QR code payment scanning.
- **Seat Availability**: Display the number of available seats in real-time.
- **Accessibility Notifications**: Alert passengers when a person with disabilities enters the bus to encourage offering them a seat.
- **Ticket Evidence**: Provide a special window after paying for a ticket that passengers can show to the bus conductor.
- **Special Needs Evidence**: After scanning a QR code, people with special needs will receive a window indicating their right to a special seat.

### Introduction of the Application
In today's fast-paced world, it's essential to use your time efficiently and be environmentally conscious. Our application aims to revolutionize the way you interact with public transportation, particularly buses.

**Account Registration and Login**: Users start by registering an account or logging in if they already have one. This is necessary to save their data and enhance the app's convenience.

**Bus Information**: The app provides comprehensive information about bus routes, allowing users to make informed decisions. Users can view precise data on a map showing the buses' real-time locations.

**Passenger Count and Special Needs**: The app also displays the current number of passengers on each bus, providing users with insights into bus occupancy. Special needs passengers can check the availability of designated seats.

**Innovative Payment System**: We've replaced the traditional bus payment method with an innovative system. Users can obtain bus tickets online by scanning special QR codes on buses. The fare will be deducted from the user's attached payment card.

**Ticket and Special Needs Proof**: After payment, users receive a digital ticket to show to the bus conductor. Passengers with special needs receive a digital certificate confirming their conditions and their right to a special seat.

### Explanation of Frontend and Backend
**Frontend**: Our frontend is built using Flutter and Dart programming language. The application consists of several screen types based on their function.

1. **Opening Screens**: 
   - `openingscreen1`: Displayed when the app isn't ready to start.
   - `openingscreen2`: Shown once all resources are processed, displaying the Uber logo, slogan "Move with safety," and a "Get Started" button.

2. **Authorization Screens**:
   - `login_block`: Allows existing users to log in.
   - `registration_block`: For new users to register. Collects user information and handles errors.

3. **Main Functionality Screens**: These screens provide access to the app's core features, including bus routes, real-time maps, passenger counts, and special needs options.

### Results and Projection of App Usage
The application is expected to significantly improve the efficiency and convenience of using public buses. Users will be able to make informed decisions about their bus routes, access real-time information on bus locations, and benefit from an innovative payment system. Passengers with special needs will have their rights protected, and other passengers will be encouraged to offer them seats. Overall, the "Universal Bus Solution" aims to enhance the bus travel experience for all passengers while promoting a more eco-friendly mode of transportation.
